Challenges of Experimental Analysis

• Experimental running times of two algorithms are difficult to directly com- pare unless the experiments are performed in the same hardware and software environments.
• Experiments can be done only on a limited set of test inputs; hence, they leave out the running times of inputs not included in the experiment (and these inputs may be important).
• An algorithm must be fully implemented in order to execute it to study its running time experimentally.
