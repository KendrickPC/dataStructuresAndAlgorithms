# Write a pseudo-code description of a function that reverses a list of n
# integers, so that the numbers are listed in the opposite order than they
# were before, and compare this method to an equivalent Python function
# for doing the same thing.

# Hint: The Python function does not need to be passed the value of n as an argument.

# k = 1

# reverse_list = []

# for n in list:
#   reverse_list += list[len(list) - k]
#   k++

# print([n for n in reversed([1, 2, 3])])
