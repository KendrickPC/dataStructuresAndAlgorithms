# Write a Python function that takes a sequence of numbers
# and determines if all the numbers are different from each
# other (that is, they are distinct).

# Hint: The simple solution just checks each number against every other
# one, but we will discuss better solutions later in the book.
# But make sure you donâ€™t compare a number to itself.
